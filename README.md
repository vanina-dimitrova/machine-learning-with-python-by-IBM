# Final Project: Machine Learning with Python by IBM
As part of the Machine Learning with Python course by IBM, I developed a project focused on building and evaluating multiple classification models using different algorithms, including **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Tree**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression**.

The project involved pre-processing the dataset, selecting features, and tuning the models to improve accuracy. I used libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and SciPy to implement the algorithms and compare their performance on both the training and test sets. The final report includes accuracy metrics and insights gained from optimizing the models for better performance.
